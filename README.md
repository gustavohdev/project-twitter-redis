# Simple Clone of Twiiter with Redis

# To Run
- You need Redis running in your PC
- [Redis]https://medium.com/@RedisLabs/windows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl-10e3ca4d434e
- clone or download the app
``` sh
npm install
npm install -g nodemon
nodemon app.js
```
- Follow each other before send messages

# Implemented
- We added a signup/registration on top of Redis
- We allowed people to follow each other
- We enabled messaging

# Future implementations

- Allow users to logout
- After a while the number of people will be so big that the current “people discovery” system is not ideal any more. Find a better solution, perhaps showing the people that use the app the most
- Add profile pictures
- Allow to upload images
- Implement “favorites”
- Implement a way to reply to messages
