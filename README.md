# Simple Clone of Twiiter with Redis

# Implemented
- We added a signup/registration on top of Redis
- We allowed people to follow each other
- We enabled messaging
- You can expand the project if you want, and I suggest the following:

# Future implementations

- Allow users to logout
- After a while the number of people will be so big that the current “people discovery” system is not ideal any more. Find a better solution, perhaps showing the people that use the app the most
- Add profile pictures
- Allow to upload images
- Implement “favorites”
- Implement a way to reply to messages
